install_dependencies -> ubuntu





/install folder with install instructions and scripts:

Distinguish between
1) fully external libs
2) integrated extern libs

For each fully external lib there should be a script that
1) downloads the source from some shared folder to /home/lib/tmp
2) patches and configures it
3) compiles it
4) installs it in /home/lib/32 or /home/lib/64

(Should home/lib/32|64 be a shared folder? Arch/Ubuntu ?)
