The currently only way to learn about this code and understand what is can do it to go through all examples.

Start with

examples/Core  examples/Gui examples/Ors

All of them should work. Going through the main should be instructive on how you could use the features. In examples/Ors some demos depend on linking to Physx which is turned off on default.

Continue with more specialized packages:

examples/Optim examples/Motion examples/Algo examples/Infer

which implement algorithmic methods


Finally examples/Hardware contains drivers/recorders for Kinect, Cams, G4

examples/System is code for designing parallized modular systems (using Core/module.h) - which I think works robustly but needs more tools for others to be usable.

examples/relational is Tobias relational RL code
