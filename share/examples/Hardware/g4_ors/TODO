1) sometimes gets blocked at waitForNextWriteAccess();

2) sometimes sensors read all 0s. In this case we should either define a
standard INVALID value, or just use the values just previous to the "jump".

Probably better to leave all 0s as a standard INVALID flag, then the application
which actually reads the values can choose what to do with it..

3) I encountered a weird bug once. The timestamp continued, but the video
looped..
