*** WELCOME to the KOMO executable ***

(KOMO = k-order Markov Constrained Motion Optimization)
(see http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0414 )

This is executable reads the specs of a motion or pose
optimization problem from a file, and writes the results
into a file. The syntax of both files is, surprise, our
graph-file syntax. The specs file is given on command line
('specs.g' by default).
