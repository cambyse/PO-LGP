*** WELCOME to the KOMO executable ***

(KOMO = k-order Markov Constrained Motion Optimization)
(see http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0414 )

This is executable reads the specs of a motion or pose optimization
problem from a file, and writes the results into files. The generated
files contain cost information, and the final pose.  The syntax all
files is our graph-file syntax. Use:

./x.exe <specsfile> <output-refix>

by default:
<specsfile> = specs.g
<output-refix> = z
