Description
-----------

Reach and grasp an object with giiven coordinates and shape using implicit
surface representation and a reactive controller.

General instructions
--------------------

- Most parameters have reasonable defaults in the MT.cfg
- Specific parameters are

  - shape: 0 = sphere, 2 = cylinder, ... see the code
  - center [c1, c2, c3] is the center of the synthetic potential function
    (object)
  - radius is the imaginary radius of the obj
  - sigma is the parameter of the RBF exp(- s * dist*dist) used as potential
    function
  - sudo is needed only if you want the gui to be niced leaving more time for
    the hardware control NOTE: then, any created by x.exe files are owned by
    root. In particular, if you start again without sudo, you typically will
    not be able to write to the plot files!!!

- start with something like 

    make && sudo ./x.exe -shape 2 \
      -center "[ -.5 -.6 1.3 ]" -sigma 2 -radius .06   && ./plot.sh

  This one brings Grobi to grasp an object in front of the camera

    make && ./x.exe -center "[.6 -.4 1.1 ]" -sigma 10 -radius .002 
    make && ./x.exe -center "[.0 -.9 .8 ]" \
      -shape 2 -height .15  -sigma 5 -radius .04  && ./plot.sh


Issues
------

- correction of calibration error  (radius and shift)
- too short trajectories seem to not allow for precise reach and opening the
  fingers?
- ...  

Notes
-----

working with skin:

take care of
- skin pressure threshold (search for 'lift')
- threshold to activate skin  
- vision biased center of object +some mm
