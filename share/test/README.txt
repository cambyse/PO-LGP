GIT-directory: mlr/src/share/test/

This file lists all *up-to-date* tests in alphabetic order.

Tests serve you in two ways:
(1) Check whether the lib code has been compiled correctly and runs on your
    machine
(2) Learn how to use the libs by means of demos
(Please note the difference to projects found in mlr/projects/.)
