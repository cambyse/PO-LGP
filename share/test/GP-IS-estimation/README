Object estimation
=================

Diefferent demos related to object estimation with Gaussian Process Implicit
Surface in several scenarios. All evidence is simulated.

Scenarios include learning from ground truth given as
  - ISF, 
    - produced by a GP at randrom
    - produced from a analitical body, e.g. cylinder
  - mesh 
Observations are generated
  - from gradient walk (ISF)
  - from random rays crossing a mesh (ISF,mesh)
  - from sampling vertices frrom the mesh (ISF,mesh)

Furthermore there are several altertaivees for measuring estimation quality
(distance between ground truth and estimate)
  - common volume to true volume ratio (penalized by the falsely estimated
    volume) (applicable to ISF)  (V_com-V_out) / V_true   
  - similar view (sample rays, compare intersection points with true and est.
    mesh) (applic. mesh)

Usage
-----

./x.exe
-with_GL 1          # show true and estimate in GL windows
-gl_auto 1          # auto advance vs. press Enter
-showeveryith 10    # show state after every 10th observation
-showuntil 5        # show state for every observation until 5th
-objsize 1          # approx. obj size (for random objs) (Var of unif. distr.)
-center "[ 0,0,0 ]" # center of unif distr for sampling functions
-height .25         # height (of a predefined primitive body (cylinder))
-radius .25         # height (of a predefined primitive body (cylinder))
-meshfile foo.tri   # file to get mesh from (for learning from mesh)
-gp_size .2         # size of GP used for estimation
-demo 4             # show predefined demo 4 (see source, end of file)
-rnd_srfc_seed 41   # seed for random obj geneartaion
-observations 120   # number of total observations to make
-finalbelieffile belief.tri     # where to save the final belief


Automated experiments
---------------------

Look into  ./exp1.sh  (assumes Sun Grid Engine in the very inner line)

Misc
----

Use
  # ors_file_converter belief.tri -view
to inspect a mesh. 

Examples
--------

- animation of nontrivial obj estimation

./x.exe -demo 1 -gl_auto 0 -with_GL 1 -gp_size 1 -center '[0, 0, 0]'  -rnd_srfc_seed 41 -showeveryith 10 -showuntil 6
