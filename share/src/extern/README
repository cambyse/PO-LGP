This directory is ONLY for sources that we maintain!

When linking to a proper external library, which is properly
maintained, then create an install script (template: PHYSX).

This directory only contains sources by libs or source code, developed
usually by other researchers, which are not properly maintained and
which we therefore totally reorganize to be aligned with our make
system.
