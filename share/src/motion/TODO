*** GENERAL

** each process should have its own `cout??' That would make tracking outputs much easier!

** Parameters

- trace back EVERY parameter
- there must not be `hard numbers' anywhere in the code
- all parameters must be declared as parameters of a process
- all parameters are loaded in `open' of process

** Code reviewing

- read through all code
- perhaps add little code explainations (but don't change the `compact formatting' too much, please)
- question everything

** Parameters: typical use case:
- imagine we tune the parameters for the grasp. Ideally this should look like this: the keyframe optimizer is running permanently.
  We have a gui for tweaking the parameters, the KeframeOptimizer responds immediatly - we can directly see the effect!!

** Why does ors clone/copy require write access??

*** MOTION SPECIFIC

** The MotionPrimitive is now also the KeyframeOptimizer. But this became natural because the keyframe task depends totally on the action...
