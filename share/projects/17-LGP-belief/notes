DONE Every joint has an interval attached.

DONE Each interval is a DOF, adds to qdim

DONE display: generate 2U extreme qs, fwdPropagate, display; just overlay all of them, or maybe just sample 10 and display them

MAYBE DONT:
- add activeUncertainties; #=U
- the intervals translate to a global covariance matrix

the covariance matrix translated to shifted inequalities (no other impact!) -- implement this within TaskMap? (Because that has access to the config, including uncertainties)

Missing: the derivative w.r.t. the interval parameters of the inequality...

DONE design an objective function that mimics the blief dynamics (i.e. puts growth on the belief)

NOW: modulate that dynamics with sensor
