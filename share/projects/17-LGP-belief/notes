DONE Every joint has an interval attached.

Each interval is a DOF, adds to qdim

add activeUncertainties; #=U

DONE display: generate 2U extreme qs, fwdPropagate, display; just overlay all of them, or maybe just sample 10 and display them

the intervals translate to a global covariance matrix

the covariance matrix translated to shifted inequalities (no other impact!) -- implement this within TaskMap? (Because that has access to the config, including uncertainties)

Missing: the derivative w.r.t. the interval parameters of the inequality...
