* Implement FixAttachedObjects TaskMap: For every object O that is attached to a new joint, compute the relative vel to the previous parent, and the relative vel to the new parent. Both should be zero. (Is there a difficulty with quat velocities? modulo?...)

1. Variant: constrain the vel to be zero.

* Implement poseTMT, which is quat+pos 

* Implement a TaskMap AboveBox, which is 4D and computes the differences to the box edges (4 inequality constraints)
