# search:

always random MC, not priority queue (random tree policy)

remove the WAIT thing

infeasible -> add symbolic block (which also produces Quit symbol) & remove previous MC statistics! (HOW?)

Always recompute all 'statistics' from leaf statistics only (back project)

remove nodes of the tree? (illustrate RED)

# robustness:

optimizer sometimes breaks (Hessian...) -> ?

# write:

make algo systematic!!


# fluent hand-over:

* Implement FixAttachedObjects TaskMap: For every object O that is attached to a new joint, compute the relative vel to the previous parent, and the relative vel to the new parent. Both should be zero. (Is there a difficulty with quat velocities? modulo?...)
(DONE, mostly:)

1. Variant: constrain the vel to be zero. (DONE)

* Implement poseTMT, which is quat+pos -- why?

* Implement a TaskMap AboveBox, which is 4D and computes the differences to the box edges (4 inequality constraints) -- why?
