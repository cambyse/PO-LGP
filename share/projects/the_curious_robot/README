The Curious Robot
=================

This is the implementation of "The Curious Robot" (TCR) project.


# Prerequisites & Setup
TCR uses ROS and the MLR code. This section explains how to setup everything.


## Prerequisites

- use Ubuntu 12.04
- install libgsl0-dev to make it work

    sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev

- install ros fuerte and additional packages:

    sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full ros-fuerte-rqt

  see http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu
- create a ros fuerte workspace in ~/fuerte_workspace and a sandbox directory
  ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
  see http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
- install the ros articulation package by Sturm

    rosws set alufr-ros-pkg --svn http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

- compile articulation

    rosmake articulation


## Setup
- create a link from ~/git/mlr/share/projects/the_curious_robot/ to ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/the_curious_robot
- call cmake and in ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/the_curious_robot/ to compile
  the project

    cmake .
    make
    rosmake the_curious_robot


## Run

    cd ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/the_curious_robot/src
    # start TCR
    roslauch the_curious_robot.launch
    # start the smach viewer
    rosrun smach_viewer smach_viewer.py



# Task
Learn model s.t. I can predict the outcome of my actions.

Behavior must be able to set
- goal position
- push vector
- (additional actions like "grap")

- simulate action in ors
- do action in the world
- calculate distance of |sim-world| --> measure for model


## How to choose actions (and how to learn)?

- given a list of objects (shapes whatever)
- take "interesting objects"
- move towards object
- each object has a list of popential interesting properties
  - type=[Fix, dynamic]
  - joints
  - limits
  - weight
  - friction
  - etc
- explore and learn uncertain properties

Note: **uncertainties** probably can be represented as Gaussians.


# Random Ideas
- use learned "model templates" to predict behavior of unknown objects
