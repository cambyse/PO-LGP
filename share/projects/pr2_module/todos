* use force sensor:
  * get fL and fR from the two force sensors as message
  * have fL_ref adn fR_ref as messages
  * add directly to efforts: J^T (fL_ref-fL)
  * does that work???
  * how adapt q_ref? Reduce gains?
* have a Kd_gainFactor, Kp_gainFactor, fL_.. fR_.. \in[0,1] message

* POSTPONE: feedback? q_obs -> q?
