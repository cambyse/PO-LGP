* src include lib:
  * the three core paths, including sources, extra includes, compiled so

* make-generic:
  * a (too?) long file containing generic make rules
  * is included by ALL other Makefiles
  * we can now simplify many parts

* make-locked.sh:
  * parallelized make somtimes calls make twice in the same directory
  * this script avoids it

* src:
  * each subfolder contains a pice of code that is compiled in libPathName.so
  * this contains the bulk of the code

* include:
  * src paths include the headers
  * but for some external libs there are extra headers here

* lib:
  * compiled libs

* slices:
  * I call parts of the code that I publish on my webpage as 'slices'
  * we have slices for the ML and Robotics lecture
  * slices for Array, MotionPlanning, Ors, etc
  * Tobias' code is a slice (Armani, etc)

* unittest:
  * the sorry state of a first attempt to unit test

* projects:
  * things that go beyond being small examples
  * see also /mlr/retired/projects

* teaching:
  * exercises and solutions for lectures (distributed with slices)

* data:
  * we have a separate data repos - should be clarified

* configurations:
  * ors configurations (kinematic descriptions of robots)
  * mesh files for robot descriptions
  * other configuration stuff

* bin:
  * some useful scripts (e.g. hardware startup)
  * sym_links (e.g. ors_editor/x.exe)

* retired/test:
  * older folder including many older examples - not to be forgotton
