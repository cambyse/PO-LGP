  abstract = {In practical classification, there is often a mix of learnable and unlearnable classes and only a classifier above a minimum performance threshold can be deployed. This problem is exacerbated if the training set is created by active learning. The bias of actively learned training sets makes it hard to determine whether a class has been learned. We give evidence that there is no general and efficient method for reducing the bias and correctly identifying classes that have been learned. However, we characterize a number of scenarios where active learning can succeed despite these difficulties.},

  isbn = {978-1-4503-0055-1},
  abstract = {Active learning (AL) is an increasingly popular strategy for mitigating the amount of labeled data required to train classifiers, thereby reducing annotator effort. We describe a real-world, deployed application of AL to the problem of biomedical citation screening for systematic reviews at the Tufts Medical Center's Evidence-based Practice Center. We propose a novel active learning strategy that exploits a priori domain knowledge provided by the expert (specifically, labeled features)and extend this model via a Linear Programming algorithm for situations where the expert can provide ranked labeled features. Our methods outperform existing AL strategies on three real-world systematic review datasets. We argue that evaluation must be specific to the scenario under consideration. To this end, we propose a new evaluation framework for finite-pool scenarios, wherein the primary aim is to label a fixed set of examples rather than to simply induce a good predictive model. We use a method from medical decision theory for eliciting the relative costs of false positives and false negatives from the domain expert, constructing a utility measure of classification performance that integrates the expert preferences. Our findings suggest that the expert can, and should, provide more information than instance labels alone. In addition to achieving strong empirical results on the citation screening problem, this work outlines many important steps for moving away from simulated active learning and toward deploying AL for real-world applications.},

@article{harnad_symbol_1990,
  title = {The symbol grounding problem},
  volume = {42},
  issn = {0167-2789},
  abstract = {There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the “symbol grounding problem”: How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g. “An X is a Y that is Z”). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic “module,” however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically “dedicated” symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.},

  abstract = {This article can be viewed as an attempt to explore the consequences of two propositions. (1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4.“Could a machine think?” On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.},

SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster.

This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps.

The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF’s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF’s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that the Kalman filter for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) converges to a fully correlated map in the limit of infinite time and data [1]. However, the rate of convergence of the map has a strong dependence on the order of the observations. We show that conventional exploration algorithms for collecting map data are sub-optimal in both the objective function and choice of optimization procedure. We show that optimizing the a-optimal information measure results in a more accurate map than existing approaches, using a greedy, closed-loop strategy. Secondly, we demonstrate that by restricting the planning to an appropriate policy class, we can tractably find non-greedy, global planning trajectories that produce more accurate maps, explicitly planning to close loops even in open-loop scenarios.},

  abstract = {Background  We developed a practical influenza forecast model based on real-time, geographically focused, and easy to access data, designed to provide individual medical centers with advanced warning of the expected number of influenza cases, thus allowing for sufficient time to implement interventions. Secondly, we evaluated the effects of incorporating a real-time influenza surveillance system, Google Flu Trends, and meteorological and temporal information on forecast accuracy.    Methods  Forecast models designed to predict one week in advance were developed from weekly counts of confirmed influenza cases over seven seasons (2004–2011) divided into seven training and out-of-sample verification sets. Forecasting procedures using classical Box-Jenkins, generalized linear models (GLM), and generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GARMA) methods were employed to develop the final model and assess the relative contribution of external variables such as, Google Flu Trends, meteorological data, and temporal information.    Results  A GARMA(3,0) forecast model with Negative Binomial distribution integrating Google Flu Trends information provided the most accurate influenza case predictions. The model, on the average, predicts weekly influenza cases during 7 out-of-sample outbreaks within 7 cases for 83\% of estimates. Google Flu Trend data was the only source of external information to provide statistically significant forecast improvements over the base model in four of the seven out-of-sample verification sets. Overall, the p-value of adding this external information to the model is 0.0005. The other exogenous variables did not yield a statistically significant improvement in any of the verification sets.    Conclusions  Integer-valued autoregression of influenza cases provides a strong base forecast model, which is enhanced by the addition of Google Flu Trends confirming the predictive capabilities of search query based syndromic surveillance. This accessible and flexible forecast model can be used by individual medical centers to provide advanced warning of future influenza cases.},

The method allows for an iterative bootstrapping and refinement of the inverse kinematics estimate. The essential novelty lies in a path-based sampling approach: we generate training data along paths, which result from execution of the currently learned estimate along a desired path towards a goal. The information structure thereby induced enables an efficient detection and resolution of inconsistent samples solely from directly observable data. We derive and illustrate the exploration and learning process with a low-dimensional kinematic example that provides direct insight into the bootstrapping process. We further show that the method scales for high dimensional problems, such as the Honda humanoid robot or hyperredundant planar arms with up to 50 degrees of freedom.},

This study evaluates the role of exploration in active learning and describes several local techniques for exploration in finite, discrete domains, embedded in a reinforcement learning framework (delayed reinforcement). This paper distinguishes between two families of exploration schemes: undirected and directed exploration.  While the former family is closely related to random walk exploration, directed exploration techniques memorize exploration-specific knowledge which is used for guiding the exploration search. In many finite deterministic domains, any learning technique based on undirected exploration is inefficient in terms of learning time, i.e. learning time is expected to scale exponentially with the size of the state space (Whitehead, 1991b) . We prove that for all these domains, reinforcement learning using a directed technique can always be performed in polynomial time, demonstrating the important role of e...},

  abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Self-Adaptive Goal Generation Robust Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity (SAGG-RIAC) architecture as an intrinsically motivated goal exploration mechanism which allows active learning of inverse models in high-dimensional redundant robots. This allows a robot to efficiently and actively learn distributions of parameterized motor skills/policies that solve a corresponding distribution of parameterized tasks/goals. The architecture makes the robot sample actively novel parameterized tasks in the task space, based on a measure of competence progress, each of which triggers low-level goal-directed learning of the motor policy parameters that allow to solve it. For both learning and generalization, the system leverages regression techniques which allow to infer the motor policy parameters corresponding to a given novel parameterized task, and based on the previously learnt correspondences between policy and task parameters.

We present experiments with high-dimensional continuous sensorimotor spaces in three different robotic setups: (1) learning the inverse kinematics in a highly-redundant robotic arm, (2) learning omnidirectional locomotion with motor primitives in a quadruped robot, and (3) an arm learning to control a fishing rod with a flexible wire. We show that (1) exploration in the task space can be a lot faster than exploration in the actuator space for learning inverse models in redundant robots; (2) selecting goals maximizing competence progress creates developmental trajectories driving the robot to progressively focus on tasks of increasing complexity and is statistically significantly more efficient than selecting tasks randomly, as well as more efficient than different standard active motor babbling methods; (3) this architecture allows the robot to actively discover which parts of its task space it can learn to reach and which part it cannot.},

  abstract = {Reliable vision-based grasping has proved elusive outside of controlled environments. One approach towards building more flexible and domain-independent robot grasping systems is to employ learning to adapt the robot's perceptual and motor system to the task. However, one pitfall in robot perceptual and motor learning is that the cost of gathering the learning set may be unacceptably high. Active learning algorithms address this shortcoming by intelligently selecting actions so as to decrease the number of examples necessary to achieve good performance and also avoid separate training and execution phases, leading to higher autonomy. We describe the IE-ID3 algorithm, which extends the Interval Estimation (IE) active learning approach from discrete to real-valued learning domains by combining IE with a classification tree learning algorithm (ID-3). We present a robot system which rapidly learns to select the grasp approach directions using IE-ID3 given simplified superquadric shape approximations of objects. Initial results on a small set of objects show that a robot with a laser scanner system can rapidly learn to pick up new objects, and simulation studies show the superiority of the active learning approach for a simulated grasping task using larger sets of objects. Extensions of the approach and future areas of research incorporating more sophisticated perceptual and action representation are discussed},

Experiments are performed across two syntactic learning tasks and within the single task of parsing across two learning models to compare the effect of different predictive criteria. We find that sample selection can significantly reduce the size of annotated training corpora and that uncertainty is a robust predictive criterion that can be easily applied to different learning models.},

While selecting where to grasp requires learning about the object as a whole, the execution only needs to reactively adapt to the context close to the grasp’s location. We propose a hierarchical controller that reflects the structure of these two sub-problems, and attempts to learn solutions that work for both. A hybrid architecture is employed by the controller to make use of various machine learning methods that can cope with the large amount of uncertainty inherent to the task. The controller’s upper level selects where to grasp the object using a reinforcement learner, while the lower level comprises an imitation learner and a vision-based reactive controller to determine appropriate grasping motions. The resulting system is able to quickly learn good grasps of a novel object in an unstructured environment, by executing smooth reaching motions and preshaping the hand depending on the object’s geometry. The system was evaluated both in simulation and on a real robot.},

As robots accomplish tasks by interacting with the physical world, we can facilitate representation learning by considering the structure imposed by physics; this structure is reflected in the changes that occur in the world and in the way a robot can effect them. By exploiting this structure in learning, robots can obtain state representations consistent with the aspects of physics relevant to the learning task. We name this prior knowledge about the structure of interactions with the physical world robotic priors. We identify five robotic priors and explain how they can be used to learn pertinent state representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated and real robotic experiments with distracting moving objects. We show that our method extracts task-relevant state representations from high-dimensional observations, even in the presence of task-irrelevant distractions. We also show that the state representations learned by our method greatly improve generalization in reinforcement learning.},

CRAM equips autonomous robots with lightweight reasoning mechanisms that can infer control decisions rather than requiring the decisions to be preprogrammed. This way CRAM-programmed autonomous robots are much more flexible, reliable, and general than control programs that lack such cognitive capabilities. CRAM does not require the whole domain to be stated explicitly in an abstract knowledge base. Rather, it grounds symbolic expressions in the knowledge representation into the perception and actuation routines and into the essential data structures of the control programs. In the accompanying video, we show complex mobile manipulation tasks performed by our household robot that were realized using the CRAM infrastructure.},

  title = {Confidence-based progress-driven self-generated goals for skill acquisition in developmental robots},
  volume = {4},
  abstract = {A reinforcement learning agent that autonomously explores its environment can utilize a curiosity drive to enable continual learning of skills, in the absence of any external rewards. We formulate curiosity-driven exploration, and eventual skill acquisition, as a selective sampling problem. Each environment setting provides the agent with a stream of instances. An instance is a sensory observation that, when queried, causes an outcome that the agent is trying to predict. After an instance is observed, a query condition, derived herein, tells whether its outcome is statistically known or unknown to the agent, based on the confidence interval of an online linear classifier. Upon encountering the first unknown instance, the agent “queries” the environment to observe the outcome, which is expected to improve its confidence in the corresponding predictor. If the environment is in a setting where all instances are known, the agent generates a plan of actions to reach a new setting, where an unknown instance is likely to be encountered. The desired setting is a self-generated goal, and the plan of action, essentially a program to solve a problem, is a skill. The success of the plan depends on the quality of the agent's predictors, which are improved as mentioned above. For validation, this method is applied to both a simulated and real Katana robot arm in its “blocks-world” environment. Results show that the proposed method generates sample-efficient curious exploration behavior, which exhibits developmental stages, continual learning, and skill acquisition, in an intrinsically-motivated playful agent.},

When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate—everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments.},

  abstract = {This article describes a method of “grouping” and “collapsing” in using the Gibbs sampler and proves from an operator theory viewpoint that the method is in general beneficial. The norms of the forward operators associated with the corresponding nonreversible Markov chains are used to discriminate among different simulation schemes. When applied to Bayesian missing data problems, the idea of collapsing suggests skipping the steps of sampling parameter(s) values in standard data augmentation. By doing this, we obtain a predictive update version of the Gibbs sampler. A procedure of calculating the posterior odds ratio via the collapsed Gibbs sampler when incomplete observations are involved is presented. As an illustration of possible applications, three examples, along with a Bayesian treatment for identifying common protein binding sites in unaligned DNA sequences, are provided.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Developmental robotics is an emerging field located at the intersection of robotics, cognitive science and developmental sciences. This paper elucidates the main reasons and key motivations behind the convergence of fields with seemingly disparate interests, and shows why developmental robotics might prove to be beneficial for all fields involved. The methodology advocated is synthetic and two-pronged: on the one hand, it employs robots to instantiate models originating from developmental sciences; on the other hand, it aims to develop better robotic systems by exploiting insights gained from studies on ontogenetic development. This paper gives a survey of the relevant research issues and points to some future research directions.},

  abstract = {Most previous work on artificial curiosity (AC) and intrinsic motivation focuses on basic concepts and theory. Experimental results are generally limited to toy scenarios, such as navigation in a simulated maze, or control of a simple mechanical system with one or two degrees of freedom. To study AC in a more realistic setting, we embody a curious agent in the complex iCub humanoid robot. Our novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework consists of a state-of-the-art, low-level, reactive control layer, which controls the iCub while respecting constraints, and a high-level curious agent, which explores the iCub's state-action space through information gain maximization, learning a world model from experience, controlling the actual iCub hardware in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever embodied, curious agent for real-time motion planning on a humanoid. We demonstrate that it can learn compact Markov models to represent large regions of the iCub's configuration space, and that the iCub explores intelligently, showing interest in its physical constraints as well as in objects it finds in its environment.},

  abstract = {Gathering the most information by picking the least amount of data is a common task in experimental design or when exploring an unknown environment in reinforcement learning and robotics. A widely used measure for quantifying the information contained in some distribution of interest is its entropy. Greedily minimizing the expected entropy is therefore a standard method for choosing samples in order to gain strong beliefs about the underlying random variables. We show that this approach is prone to temporally getting stuck in local optima corresponding to wrongly biased beliefs. We suggest instead maximizing the expected cross entropy between old and new belief, which aims at challenging refutable beliefs and thereby avoids these local optima. We show that both criteria are closely related and that their difference can be traced back to the asymmetry of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In illustrative examples as well as simulated and real-world experiments we demonstrate the advantage of cross entropy over simple entropy for practical applications.},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is balancing exploration and exploitation. We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E3 and R-MAX algorithms. Efficient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efficiency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efficient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.},

Engineering sensors and components useful for science investigations include stereo navigation cameras, stereo hazard cameras in front and rear, wheel motors, wheel motor current and voltage, the wheels themselves for digging, gyros, accelerometers, and reference solar cell readings. Mission operations will allow commanding of the rover each Martian day, or sol, on the basis of the previous sol's data. Over a 90-sol mission lifetime, the rovers are expected to drive hundreds of meters while carrying out field geology investigations, exploration, and atmospheric characterization.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

For tasks such as grasping, there are no reliable success measures available. Defining reward functions by hand requires extensive task knowledge and often leads to undesired emergent behavior. We introduce a framework, wherein the robot simultaneously learns an action policy and a model of the reward function by actively querying a human expert for ratings. We represent the reward model using a Gaussian process and evaluate several classical acquisition functions (AFs) from the Bayesian optimization literature in this context. Furthermore, we present a novel AF, expected policy divergence. We demonstrate results of our method for a robot grasping task and show that the learned reward function generalizes to a similar task. Additionally, we evaluate the proposed novel AF on a real robot pendulum swing-up task.},

Yet, what intrinsic motivation may mean computationally, and how it may differ from extrinsic motivation, remains a murky and controversial subject. In this paper, we adopt an evolutionary perspective and define a new optimal reward framework that captures the pressure to design good primary reward functions that lead to evolutionary success across environments. The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally. Rather, the directness of the relationship between rewarding behavior and evolutionary success varies along a continuum.},

The proposed system allows a robot to effectively segment textureless objects in cluttered scenes by leveraging its manipulation capabilities. In our pipeline, the cluttered scenes are first statically segmented using state-of-the-art classification algorithm and then the interactive segmentation is deployed in order to resolve this possibly ambiguous static segmentation. In the second step the RGBD (RGB + Depth) sparse features, estimated on the RGBD point cloud from the Kinect sensor, are extracted and tracked while motion is induced into a scene. Using the resulting feature poses, the features are then assigned to their corresponding objects by means of a graph-based clustering algorithm. In the final step, we reconstruct the dense models of the objects from the previously clustered sparse RGBD features. We evaluated the approach on a set of scenes which consist of various textureless flat (e.g. box-like) and round (e.g. cylinder-like) objects and the combinations thereof.},

We describe a formalism for active concept learning calledselective sampling and show how it may be approximately implemented by a neural network. In selective sampling, a learner receives distribution information from the environment and queries an oracle on parts of the domain it considers “useful.” We test our implementation, called anSG-network, on three domains and observe significant improvement in generalization.},

  abstract = {Active learning is well-suited to many problems in natural language processing, where unlabeled data may be abundant but annotation is slow and expensive. This paper aims to shed light on the best active learning approaches for sequence labeling tasks such as information extraction and document segmentation. We survey previously used query selection strategies for sequence models, and propose several novel algorithms to address their shortcomings. We also conduct a large-scale empirical comparison using multiple corpora, which demonstrates that our proposed methods advance the state of the art.},

  abstract = {This is the first of two papers that use off-training set (OTS) error to investigate the assumption-free relationship between learning algorithms. This first paper discusses the senses in which there are no a priori distinctions between learning algorithms. (The second paper discusses the senses in which there are such distinctions.) In this first paper it is shown, loosely speaking, that for any two algorithms A and B, there are “as many” targets (or priors over targets) for which A has lower expected OTS error than B as vice versa, for loss functions like zero-one loss. In particular, this is true if A is cross-validation and B is “anti-cross-validation” (choose the learning algorithm with largest cross-validation error). This paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these results for computational learning theory. It is shown that one cannot say: if empirical misclassification rate is low, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of your generalizer is small, and the training set is large, then with high probability your OTS error is small. Other implications for “membership queries” algorithms and “punting” algorithms are also discussed.},

Motivated by human social learning, we believe that a transparent learning process can help guide the human teacher to provide the most informative instruction. We believe active learning is an inherently transparent machine learning approach because the learner formulates queries to the oracle that reveal information about areas of uncertainty in the underlying model. In this work, we implement active learning on the Simon robot in the form of nonverbal gestures that query a human teacher about a demonstration within the context of a social dialogue. Our preliminary pilot study data show potential for transparency through active learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the teaching process. However, our data also seem to indicate possible undesirable effects from the human teacher's perspective regarding balance of the interaction. These preliminary results argue for control strategies that balance leading and following during a social learning interaction.},

Most existing localization approaches are passive, i.e., they do not exploit the opportunity to control the robot's effectors during localization. This paper proposes an active localization approach. The approach is based on Markov localization and provides rational criteria for (1) setting the robot's motion direction (exploration), and (2) determining the pointing direction of the sensors so as to most efficiently localize the robot. Furthermore, it is able to deal with noisy sensors and approximative world models. The appropriateness of our approach is demonstrated empirically using a mobile robot in a structured office environment.},

This framework casts criteria from the Bayesian literature of design as part of a single coherent approach. The decision-theoretic structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.},

  abstract = {Autonomous navigation in outdoor, off-road environments requires solving complex classification problems. Obstacle detection, road following and terrain classification are examples of tasks which have been successfully approached using supervised machine learning techniques for classification. Large amounts of training data are usually necessary in order to achieve satisfactory generalization. In such cases, manually labeling data becomes an expensive and tedious process. This work describes a method for reducing the amount of data that needs to be presented to a human trainer. The algorithm relies on kernel density estimation in order to identify "interesting" scenes in a dataset. Our method does not require any interaction with a human expert for selecting the images, and only minimal amounts of tuning are necessary. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several experiments using data collected with two different vehicles. We first show that our method automatically selects those scenes from a large dataset that a person would consider "important" for classification tasks. Secondly, we show that by labeling only few of the images selected by our method, we obtain classification performance that is comparable to the one reached after labeling hundreds of images from the same dataset.},

  abstract = {In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line.},
