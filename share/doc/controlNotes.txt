* Adaptive control: compare offset between low-pass filtered real
  acceleration and desired acceleration; integrate (low-pass
  filtered); this defines an offset (a linear regression); add

  Problem: enforces exact acceleration control, which contradicts
  compliance

  Maybe solution: measure the error with the metric J K_p J^T, which
  is the compliance metric

* Use a low-pass filtered velocity in the task maps to cut the tas
  velocities

* In the formal formulation, assume a single large task space (block
  diagonal metric -> independent tasks)

* What is it that we actually want in the task spaces? Conventional:
  desired acceleration. BUT that contradicts compliance. Actually we
  want desired acceleration w.r.t. compliance metric K in task
  space. That metric we called prec so far. So we should specify
  compliances in this, not in K_p! (Why? Because of the natural gains:
  K_p and K_d should be coupled to ensure the desired motion profile
  behavior)
