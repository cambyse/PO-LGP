In case you would be interested to use my code for LSPI and KLSPI I
let 4 configuration files in the following repository (there is a
readme file):

git/mlr/share/projects/racer_learning/code/examples/RacerImitation/src/test/config_file_save/

The main.cpp for the simulation on cart-pole is at:

git/mlr/share/projects/racer_learning/code/examples/RacerImitation/src/test/main.cpp

And the code for lspi and klspi is at:

git/mlr/share/projects/racer_learning/code/examples/RacerImitation/src/

Everything is pushed on the branch "erwan".

Thank you again for the great time I had here, I hope to see you again,

Erwan
