/** \page howto_convex_meshes How to build convex meshes

A common problem of physic engines is that they cannot do collision checking of
non-convex objects/meshes efficiently.  Therefore it is necessary to divide
non-convex meshes into convex sup-parts.  This document gives a step by step
instruction to create convex sub-parts.
