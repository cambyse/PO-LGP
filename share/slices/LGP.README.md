# The LGP (Logic-Geometric Programming) slice of the MLR code base

This code is a slice of the full MLR code base, containing
basic ML methods. This is also the reason for the unusual
directory layout.

Please refer to my publications when using this code:

IJCAI'15
ICRA'17 (submitted)

In the project folder there is the literal code used for the latter
submission.


## Installation

Generically, the following should work:

cd share
make
cd projects/16-LGP-coop
make
./x.exe

On problems, maybe you have to install some more Ubuntu
packages or adapt to other OS. Please refer to the files

* README.mlr.md
* install/INSTALL_ALL_UBUNTU_PACKAGES.sh

These two refer to the whole MLR code base. You probably need to
install only a fraction of these packages.
