Sequence: touch A with eff; release A on B

1)
* constraints: (touch eff A)
* after-switch: (glue eff A)
2)
* constraints: (touch A B) (support B A) (upright A)
* after-logic: (touch eff A)!
* after-switch: (glue eff A)! (transXYPhi B A)

What relational state do we want to represent?

* the actual relational state currently?
* NEIN! nehm den "envelope state"

Definition: Given an initial geometric state $XX$ and a sequence
$a_{0:T}$, we consider all possible trajectories conditioned on
$a_{0:T}. This implies the set of possible final object configurations
of all objects. This set is constrained. We define the \emph{enveloping state}
$\G(s_0,a_{0:T}$ as the relational state that defines this set.

Definitions: The \emph{unconstrained configuration space} is
$X=\SE(3)^n$. A relational state $\G$ is a set of kinematic relations
that imply constraints on $X$; we define $X_\G = \{ x\in\X : x\covered
\G\}$ as the space of configurations conditional to a relational state
$\G$.



* check feasibility of a break: only if object is physically supported?
* On the search tree, store both, the current kinematic state; and the reachability state? OR: store both in one


Initial state:
* support(obj*, table)
