LOG in motion.cpp
double calc Body From Frames
world copy in  rrt planner?? -> delete copy
clearly introduce constraint maps as tasks -- feasibility, automatic penalty reduction


** checkJointDimension is really const (HALT if state was not set)
getJointDimension is not const

** lock in OpenGL

** Logging:

LOG(1) <<"message on level 1 (normal verbose level)";
LOG(0) <<"warning -- replaces as MT_MSG(...)";
LOG(-1) <<"error -- throws error, replaces as HALT(...)";
LOG(-2) <<"error -- exits, replaces as HALT(...)";

#define LOG(log_level) LogToken(__FILE, log_level, __FILE__, __LINE__)

struct LogToken{
       MT::String msg;
       LogToken(const char* topic, int log_level, const char* filename, uint line);
       ~LogToken();
       ostream&()(){ return msg; }
};

void setLogLevel(const char* topic, int l, bool forLogFile=false);

The destructor ~LogToken writes into the log file and
console. setLogLevel allows to adjust cout verbosity (0 by default),
and what is written into the log file (1 by default)
