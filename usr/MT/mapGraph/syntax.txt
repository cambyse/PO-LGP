tag-value list/graph

-- (hyper-)graph: every item can have list of parents

-- value is optional, may be another tag-value (sub-)graph

-- multiple tags allowed


item:
tag [more tags] [(parent-names)] [=] [value]

value:
none -> boolean
number -> double
'string' -> MT::String
[doubles] -> arr
<TypeKey ...> -> arbitrary type
(item-names) -> AnyList (subset of previously defined items)
{ item-list } -> AnyList (new subgraph of this item)

predefined TypeKeys:
<T ...> -> Transformation
<d ...> -> arr
<u ...> -> uintA


\subsection{10-08-06 relational graph format}

== Graph syntax without relations or ranges/templates:

entity-type name(parent-names){ properties as key value pairs }

name, parent-names, and description are optional

Example 1:

node a
node b
edge (a,b)

A minimalistic graph. a and b have no parents (do not connect
anything) and no properties. The edge has no name (not necessary since
no entity referes to it as parent/no hyper edges in this case) and no
properties. The edge is internally stored as directed (parent ordering
matters) but an attribute or type could label it as undirected.


Example 2:

node A{ color=blue }
node B{ color=red, value=5 }
edge (A,B){ width=2 }

with attributes...


Example 3:

Variable X { dim=2 }
Variable Y { dim=4 }
Factor f(X,Y){ f=[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] }

A factor graph (with strange coupling matrix of 8 entries).



== Syntax to define a range of entities (relational entities):

entity-type name[range-variables](parent-names){ properties }

Example 4:

Variable x[t] { dim=2 }

reads ``create a //Variable// named //x[t]// for each instantiation of
//t//''


Example 5:

Variable x[t] { dim=2 }
Factor f[t](x[t],x[t+1]) { f=[.9 .1 .1 .9] }
Factor evidence(x[0]) { f=[1 0] }

reads ``create a //Variable// named //x[t]// for each time slice;
create a //Factor f[t]// for each time slice coupling to //x[t]// and
//x[t+1]// with the specified Markov kernel; create a single factor
coupling to x[0] with the specified evidence'' -- this defines a
simple Markov chain!


Example 6:

Variable on[a,b]
Variable ball[a]
Variable table[a]
Variable free[a]

Variable move[a,b,c]

Factor move-condition[a,b,c](on[a,b],free[c]) { coupling... }

defines a relational factor graph with predicates for different
instantiations of the logical variables a,b,c (somewhere one has to
specify that a,b,c are instances of the \emph{same} domain!
