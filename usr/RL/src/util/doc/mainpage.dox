/*! \mainpage

    The Utility Library contains a collection of helper tools. These are mostly
    small functions and classes collected in the util.h file. But there are also
    some classes just too small for an own library. The Utility Library is part
    of the <a href="../../../doc/html/index.html">RL Software Suite</a>.
