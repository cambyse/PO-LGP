Tips for installation from zero (from a fresh ubuntu platform)

1) To install a SUPERset of the necessary packages execute

install/INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.sh

2) For more advance use, or to initially get rid of compile/link problems, edit

share/make-config

In this file you can unset dependencies, e.g.

MT_LAPACK=0 #to avoid need to include/link to LAPACK
MT_PHYSX=0 #to avoid linking to Physx (Nvidia simulator)
etc
