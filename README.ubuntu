Tips for installation from zero (from a fresh ubuntu platform)

1) Try compiling with the 'minimal' setting

cd share
copy make-config.default to make-config
edit in make-config and set  MAKEMODE = mlrlib_minimal
try make

2) Try compiling with the 'ubuntu' setting (requiring only ubuntu packages)

execute

install/INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.sh

set MAKEMODE = mlrlib_ubuntu in make-config
