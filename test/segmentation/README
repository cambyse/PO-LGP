[Getting started]

The following steps set up the code and feature a set of short demos on a couple
of test images.

1. Unpack UCM images in data folder
  # tar jxvf ucm.tar.bz2

2. Edit src/Makefile and change the path of variable OPENCV_PATH to your
   OpenCV folder
  OPENCV_PATH = <global/path/to/your/opencv/installation>

3. Now, in src/ run
  # make

4. Change to test/ and run the scripts in the following order:
  # ./test_ucm2tree
  # ./test_img2texturedesc
  # ./test_codebook
  # ./test_texturedesc2xysc
  # ./test_xysc2tree_texturehist
  # ./test_tree_labels
  # ./test_tree_colordesc
  # ./test_tree_shapedesc
  # ./test_tree_final_features
