2008-08-01: Additional disclaimer

This is not the original Felzenszwalb implementation. Instead
all interface have been rewritten to C++. Also, the routines
are combined in a single static library for later use.

The program code itself has only been altered marginally to be
C++ compliant. The algorithms themselves staid untouched.

Implementation of the segmentation algorithm described in:

Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation
Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher
International Journal of Computer Vision, 59(2) September 2004.



The program takes a color image (PPM format) and produces a segmentation
with a random color assigned to each region.

1) Type "make" to compile "segment".

2) Run "segment sigma k min input output".

The parameters are: (see the paper for details)

sigma: Used to smooth the input image before segmenting it.
k: Value for the threshold function.
min: Minimum component size enforced by post-processing.
input: Input image.
output: Output image.

Typical parameters are sigma = 0.5, k = 500, min = 20.
Larger values for k result in larger components in the result.
