-- SWIFT Example Application --
-------------------------------

The sample application demonstrates the ease with which an application can use
the SWIFT system.  The provided example application first creates a SWIFT_Scene
object, then adds two randomly tesselated spheres to it.  The objects then
orbit one another for a given number of steps at a given velocity.  Also
demonstrated is the setting of transformations and querying.

To find out how to run the example program type: example -h
