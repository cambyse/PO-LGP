HOWTO INSTALL THE BIROS LIBRARY

We assume you are on an Ubuntu Linux System. This works perfectly well with 
other distributions, but some package names differ and you have to find an
opencv 2.3 version yourself (or compile it by hand).

1. Install all dependencies
   """"""""""""""""""""""""

$> sudo apt-get install build-essentials realpath freeglut3-dev

   On a pretty new and plain ubuntu system I got some bugs on fonts, so I had to 
   install some fonts:

$> sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi




2. Install opencv 2.3 
   """"""""""""""""""
   The easiest way is to get it from willow garage. I steal
   the install instructions from them
	 (http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu)

	 Add the ros repository:

$> sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu oneiric main" > \
								/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

	 (If you don't use oneiric, put the name of your Ubuntu version instead. e.g. 
		lucid)

	 Add the repository gpg key:

$> wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

  Update apt

$> sudo apt-get update

   And finally install opencv:

$> sudo apt-get install libopencv2.3-dev

  The opencv-2.3.1.pc is messed up in this pacakge. We provide an own version.
  Copy that version to the appropriate location:

$> sudo cp opencv.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig




3. Build biros
   """""""""""
$> make


4. Test the use cases
   """"""""""""""""""

Vision use case.
Spawns several windows with some vision algorithms on a webcam video stream.

$> cd use_cases/vision
$> ./x.exe

Game of Life
A parallel version of Conways Game of life

$> cd use_cases/game_of_life
$> ./x.exe

Sorting
A parallel bubble sort

$> cd use_cases/sorting
$> ./x.exe
